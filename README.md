# WeatherMoss

> A weather monitoring dashboard for [Valley Camp](https://www.valleycamp.org/)

The name WeatherMoss is a take-off of a
[Weather Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_rock). 
If moss is wet, it's raining, etc. On of the project goals was to generate
an image of moss to match the current weather conditions. That has proven...
challenging.

WeatherMoss is a Phoenix LiveView application designed to show data from
several sources:
1) A MySQL Database full of weather data generated by a Davis Vantage Pro2
   weather station, and inserted into MySQL by a MeteoBridge device.
2) A Weatherflow Tempest device, broadcasting data over the LAN.
3) A Purple air sensor, making its data available over the LAN.

Beyond being a dashboard to show these details the application aims to
provide several other features:
  - Record the data from the Tempest into a database for later analysis.
  - Record the data from the Purple air sensor into a database for later
    analysis.
  - Highlight differences between the Tempest and Vantage Pro2 data.
  - Provide comparisons against historical data
  - Act as a watchdog to ensure that the MeteoBridge hasn't stopped
    collecting data from the Vantage Pro2.

We may also try and link to the Marvin component of the
[WA7VC](https://wa7vc.org) website to provide it data, and to fetch river
gauge data that it collects to integrate into the dashboard.

## Development


## Deployment

TODO: Document the Meteobridge configuration and MYSQL insert string for our
schema.

The application is designed to be deployed to a device running on the LAN
at ValleyCamp. It must have full LAN access to listen to the UDP broadcasts,
as well as access to the MySQL database that MeteoBridge writes to.
